#### Randomization — Break the Confounding Path

#### The gold standard to establish causation is a randomized controlled trial. Instead of letting patients choose their surgeon, we randomly assign them to either Dr. Dreamy or Dr. Duck.

#### This is precisely the kind of problem randomization can solve. By randomly assigning patients to surgeons, we break the potential confounding relationship where patient severity ends up correlated with choice of surgeon. Since assignment is now random rather than based on patient choice between a good-looking doctor and a doctor available more quickly, we eliminate this confounding pathway. This break allows us to assess whether surgeon identity truly matters for surgical success, or if the observed association was merely due to patient severity influencing both surgeon choice and outcomes.

#### The key to handling a common cause confounder is to stratify by the common cause. In general, this means we examine the relationship between treatment and outcome within groups that share the same value of the confounder. In our example, this means we look at patients of similar severity and compare the outcomes of the surgeons for patients of similar severity. There are mathematically sophisticated ways to do this, but here we demonstrate it visually. Since patient number lacks inherent meaning, the following figure shows patient severity on the x-axis and post-surgical symptom score on the y-axis.


### Figure 3 — Outcomes by Patient Severity (Stratification)

#### Here's the problem with graphs and statistics in general: the numbers can easily mislead you. Or rather, you can be misled *by* the numbers when you don't understand what they're really telling you.

#### When you just look at the raw data and ask who had better outcomes, Doc Dreamy wins. Lower scores look great on paper. But here's where it gets important: that association doesn't mean what you think it means. Correlation is not causation, and we all know that, but we forget it every single time because our brains are wired to see patterns and assign causes.

#### The real villain here is patient severity. It operates like a puppeteer behind the curtain, making Doc Dreamy look good by sending him easier cases while sending Doc Duck the harder ones. When you don't randomize, you can't tell the difference between "Doc Dreamy is a better surgeon" and "Doc Dreamy got lucky with his patient assignment."  On any graph or in any headline, look for the common-cause-confounder villian that is unaccounted for.

#### Randomization is an excellent defense against this kind of confounding. Flip a coin, assign patients randomly, and suddenly the puppeteer loses control. Now you can actually see who the better surgeon is. And the surprise is that it's the one who doesn't look the part. The data wasn't lying; it was just answering a different question than you thought you were asking.

#### If you can't randomize, and that's most of the time, you stratify. Look within groups of similar patient severity. Compare apples to apples, not apples to oranges. It's more work, and it's less satisfying than a clean randomized trial, but it's better than being fooled by confounding.

#### The take-home lesson: The world is messy, and the numbers will mislead you if you let them. But if you understand the structure of the problem, if you draw the DAG and think about what causes what, you can defend yourself against being fooled. Randomization when you can, stratification when you can't. The tools are simple. The hard part is remembering to use them.
